# Custom_MT4_indicators

These are some of the forex indicators I used in forex trading with MT4. Most of them are available online elsewhere, but I customized them on to display the values on the screen and to have voice alerts.

Indicators with voice alerts: (requires: speak_b6.dll)
- speaking_AC_Divergence.mq4
- speaking_CCI Divergence.mq4
- speaking_Reversal.mq4
- speaking_TK Cross.mq4 	
- speaking_MACD_Divergence.mq4 	
- speaking_MACD_Crossover.mq4

Indicators with displayed values

Risk Disclaimer:

Before deciding whether or not to participate in the Forex market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.

Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss in excess of your initial investment. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
